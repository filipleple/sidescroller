# sidescroller
Simple Mario-like sidescroller in SDL2, with some extra quirks.

The game generates the scene from the map.bmp and automatically populates it with enemies.
The enemies can be killed by jumping on top of them, any other collision bumps the player away 
and costs health.

Some aspects need to be tweaked, such as better SOLID code design and populating multi-leveled 
map images.

The sprites and images were blatantly taken from google images, as this is supposed to be 
only a quick exercise.
